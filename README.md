# Scientific Computing with Python Projects from freeCodeCamp

There are five projects that must be completed in order to obtain the Scientific Computing with Python Certification from freeCodeCamp. This repository contains every piece of Python code I've written.

1. Arithmetic Formatter.

Primary school students often arrange math problems vertically to make them simpler to solve. The goal of this project is to create a function that receives a list of strings representing arithmetic problems and returns the problems stacked vertically. The function should accept the second argument as an option. When the second argument is set to True, the responses should be displayed. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/boilerplate-arithmetic-formatter-done?v=1#arithmetic_arranger.py).

2. Time Calculator

In this project, I need to create ```add_time``` function that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter: a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM); a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes; and a starting day of the week (optional), case insensitive. The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/time-calculator) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/boilerplate-time-calculator-done?v=1#time_calculator.py).

3. Budget App

In this project, I was asked to make a ```Category``` class that would be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, etc. It is supposed to have ```deposit``` and ```withdrawal``` method that accepts an amount and description to track the flow of money, ```get_balance``` method that returns the current balance of the budget category, ```transfer``` method that transfers an amount to another budget category, and a ```check_funds``` method to check whether the transaction can be made with the current balance in consideration. When the budget object is printed, it would display the name of the category, the transaction list, and the current balance. Besides the ```Category``` class, I was asked to create a function (outside of the class) called ```create_spend_chart``` that takes a list of categories as an argument and returns a string that is a bar chart. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/boilerplate-budget-app-done?v=1#main.py).
