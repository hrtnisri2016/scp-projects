# Scientific Computing with Python Projects from freeCodeCamp

There are five projects that must be completed in order to obtain the Scientific Computing with Python Certification from freeCodeCamp. This repository contains every piece of Python code I've written.

1. Arithmetic Formatter.

Primary school students often arrange math problems vertically to make them simpler to solve. The goal of this project is to create a function that receives a list of strings representing arithmetic problems and returns the problems stacked vertically. The function should accept the second argument as an option. When the second argument is set to True, the responses should be displayed. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter) or run the code directly from [my replit](https://replit.com/@SriHartini4/boilerplate-arithmetic-formatter-done?v=1#arithmetic_arranger.py).

2. Time Calculator

In this project, I need to create ```add_time``` function that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter: a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM); a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes; and a starting day of the week (optional), case insensitive. The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/time-calculator).
